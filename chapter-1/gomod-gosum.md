`go.mod` and `go.sum` are integral parts of Go's module system, which was introduced in Go 1.11 to provide an official dependency management solution in Go.

Here's a brief explanation:

- `go.mod`: This file is located at the root of your module. It defines the module path (which is the import path used for the root directory) and the dependency requirements of your module. When you run `go mod init <module path>`, a new `go.mod` file is created in the current directory, initializing the directory as the root of a module. When you add an import to your Go files and run any go command, the required dependencies will be automatically added to the `go.mod` file.

- `go.sum`: This file is also located at the root of your module. It contains the expected cryptographic checksums of the content of specific module versions. The `go` command maintains and uses the `go.sum` file to ensure that these module versions do not change over time, providing security and reproducibility.

Here's a basic example:

Let's say you're developing a module called `myapp`. You would initialize the module with the following command:

```bash
go mod init myapp
```

This would create a `go.mod` file with the following content:

```
module myapp

go 1.14
```

If you add an import to `github.com/gorilla/mux` in your Go code and run `go build`, Go will automatically add the `github.com/gorilla/mux` module to your `go.mod` file and it might look something like this:

```
module myapp

go 1.14

require github.com/gorilla/mux v1.7.4
```

At the same time, Go will populate the `go.sum` file with the checksums of `github.com/gorilla/mux` and all its dependencies. The `go.sum` file might look something like this:

```
github.com/gorilla/mux v1.7.4 h1:VuZ8uybHlWmqV03+zRzdwKL4tUnIp1MAQtp1mIFE1bc=
github.com/gorilla/mux v1.7.4/go.mod h1:DVbg23sWSpFRCP0SfiEN6jmj59UnW/n46BH5rLB71So=
```

The above is just a high-level overview. When you work with Go modules, there's much more that you can do, including upgrading and downgrading dependencies, working with multiple modules, and more. The [official Go modules reference](https://golang.org/ref/mod) is a great resource for more information.
